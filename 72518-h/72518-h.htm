<p class="ph1">By Roger Dee</p>

<p>The Brass said, "Turn it on!" So<br>
Doc Maxey could but obey—which<br>
created one hell of a big mess.</p>

<p>THE MONSTERS HAD NO EYES BUT<br>
THEY WERE BEMS FOR A' THAT.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>Doc Maxey didn't build the Di-tube as a weapon. Furthermore, he swore,
he would be damned if he'd stand by and see it turned into one.</p>

<p>Dora and I—Dora is Doc's daughter and I'm Jerry Bivins, his
assistant—were helping him with the working model of the Di-tube
generator in his Connecticut laboratory when he made that plain to the
brass and brains of Allied Military, a delegation headed by two full
generals and guarded by a hard-jawed squad of MP's.</p>

<p>But for once the Doc was on the wrong end of a browbeating.
The generals knew their ground and they shut the Doc up like a
thirty-dollar shoe clerk.</p>

<p>"Since a state of global emergency has been declared," Three-star
Corbin said icily, "the military has full authority to commandeer the
fruits of any independent research. Eastern and Western forces are at
the ultimate in cold-war deadlock, a stalemate which must soon cripple
the economy of the world unless it is broken. Your Dimension-tube
offers an ideal weapon for ending it."</p>

<p>He was right about the deadlock if not about the Di-tube. Every
strategically important center in the Eastern Hemisphere had been
impregnably roofed since the early 1970's with the transmuscreen, a
force-shield that inerted atomic warheads to harmless isotopic lead.
We Westerners had the same protection, of course, which brought on the
stalemate. The catch was that neither side could afford to relax its
screens for an instant, and the power required to sustain those giant
force-shells was rapidly exhausting the resources of both hemispheres.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two-star Demarest was more diplomatic than Corbin but twice as pompous.</p>

<p>"As we understand it, Dr. Maxey, this Dimension-tunnel effect of
yours will permit us to dispatch robojet warheads through an—ah, a
cylindrical rift in the continuum of space to any desired part of the
globe. A rift large enough would enable us to reach through the enemy's
defense screens, short-cutting normal space in much the same manner as
a two-dimensional ant, which was crawling upon a flat sheet of paper—"</p>

<p>"Could reach the opposite side instantaneously by piercing the paper,"
Doc finished for him, fuzzing out his scrubby beard like a baited
goat. "The two of you sound like sub-juvenile idiots, mouthing moronic
oversimplifications lifted straight from the Sunday comic-tapes. You
disgust me with the human species!"</p>

<p>With that he whipped off his bifocals and stalked out. Ten seconds
later he stalked back, prodded by the business end of a neuroblast
rifle in the hands of a cold-eyed MP.</p>

<p>"Refusal to aid your country at such a time," Three-star Corbin pointed
out, "is a treasonable action, punishable by indefinite imprisonment."</p>

<p>Two-star Demarest gave him the other barrel. "Stubbornness will gain
you nothing, Doctor. Have you considered that our serum-and-psycho
corps can easily extract the necessary information from you?"</p>

<p>Hard-headed as he was, the Doc read the handwriting on the wall without
even adjusting his bifocals.</p>

<p>"You may change your minds after seeing the Subspace Twisters," he
said. "Activate the model, Gerald."</p>

<p>I flipped the switch on the three-foot bakelite cabinet that housed our
little Di-tube generator. It sizzled for a moment with a sound like
frying bacon and shot out a two-inch beam from the copper helix at the
bottom—a beam as clearly outlined as a water pipe but which couldn't
really be seen because there was nothing there.</p>

<p>Don't let that throw you. Just take my word for it—it was a two-inch
cylinder of nothing at all, a clean-cut shaft of absolute vacancy.</p>

<p>Until you looked into the twin-prism eyepiece we had rigged up, that
is. You couldn't sight directly down the tube itself because the
generator's energy feedback raised a glowing force-bubble that hung
above the cabinet like a basketball-sized neon bulb. That bubble
represented a spherical strain against superspace, so Doc said,
in compensation for the forced passage of the Di-tube through the
continuum of subspace. A demonstration of the first law of physics, to
every action an equal and opposite reaction.</p>

<p>Three-star Corbin looked first, pulling his rank. One glimpse of the
Twisters was enough—he jumped a foot and turned the color of a dead
flounder.</p>

<p>"In God's name," he choked when he got his breath back, "what <i>are</i>
they?"</p>

<p>"We don't know," I told him. "But I'll give you odds that they wouldn't
be chummy if they ever got up here."</p>

<p>I knew how he felt. My first sight of the Twisters had given me
nightmares for a week. I won't try to describe them because they never
looked alike to any two people. Doc said that a description didn't
matter because what we thought we saw were only multidimensional
cross-sections anyway—but I wouldn't know about that. To me they
looked like inside-out octopuses.</p>

<p>"You see?" Doc snapped, bristling his beard triumphantly. "The
cross-sections we see of these inhabitants of subspace give no clue
whatever as to their true nature. Even you should realise that opening
a larger rift into their domain would be an extremely dangerous
undertaking."</p>

<p>"Allied Military," said Three-star Corbin, who had got some of
his color back, "is quite capable of dealing with these brutes if
necessary. Dr. Maxey, you will proceed with the construction of a
full-scale Dimension-tunnel."</p>

<p>The doc made some sulphurous remarks that were lost in his beard.</p>

<p>"I'd rot in prison first," he growled finally, "but for the fact that
it would be suicidal to trust such equipment in the hands of morons. A
larger generator could extend a Dimension-rift clean to infinity and
sooner or later some incompetent fool would swing the beam in operation
and slice the universe in half!"</p>

<p>And that was how the brass and brains of Allied Military got their big
Di-tube generator built. It took three weeks, with Doc superintending
and Dora and me doing the work, to set it up and tune it for the test.</p>

<p>Doc, being a hard loser, made one last-ditch attempt to argue them out
of using the Di-tube.</p>

<p>"The mathematical concepts involved in this operation," he told the
generals and their white-smocked technical staff, "are obviously beyond
the grasp of your stunted intellects. Therefore I shall make shift with
your adolescent analogy of the two-dimensional ant, which improbable
brute in boring through his sheet of paper would find himself <i>for the
duration of his passage</i> in a plane totally alien and untranslatable to
terms of his own experience.</p>

<p>"Like the ant we are dealing with a wholly new concept—subspace.
My calculations show that other dimensions—there is no way of
determining how many—lie above and below our own. In short-cutting
either adjoining dimension we shall be as utterly out of our accustomed
element as the ant in the paper. Moreover the continuum we call
subspace is inhabited. Surely even you can see the danger involved?"</p>

<p>He was right, of course, but it didn't buy him anything. Nobody ever
convinced a full general with that kind of argument.</p>

<p>"Proceed with the test," ordered Three-star Corbin.</p>

<p>There was nothing else for it. Dora clung to my arm, pressing close
enough to make me almost glad of the risk we ran, while Doc obeyed
orders.</p>

<p>Doc, muttering minor blasphemies into his beard, punched the button
that activated the big generator—and loosed catastrophe, as the
telepapers later said, on an unsuspecting world.</p>

<p>The big Di-tube machine didn't sizzle like the model—it roared. The
glowing strain-bubble over the generator built up slowly to a humming
orange sphere ten feet across. The cylindrical shaft of nothingness
that speared out of the under side helix punched a hole like a mine
shaft in the laboratory floor, a vertical tunnel of absolute vacancy
that twisted the eyes half out of our heads with its brain-wrenching
alienness.</p>

<p>The Twisters were out in force, swarming around in the big beam and
looking more than ever like inside-out octopuses. They didn't have any
eyes, as far as I could see, but I could feel them staring upward,
studying us.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> will you listen to reason?" Doc demanded, and reached for the
switch. "I'm going to turn off the beam, before—"</p>

<p>Catastrophe stopped him.</p>

<p>The big orange strain-bubble over the Di-tube generator exploded like
an A-bomb. Concussion rocked the room, shattering windows and piling
brasshats and technicians together in aimless heaps. Dora and I landed
together in a corner, knocking over the little cabinet that housed our
first model Di-tube generator.</p>

<p>The big generator overloaded, pouring out black smoke. Relays slammed
like triphammers, shutting off current. The Di-tube shaft in the floor
blinked out, taking the Twisters with it.</p>

<p>But another Dimension-tunnel speared downward through the roof, ending
at the spot where the exploded strain-bubble had been. <i>And it wasn't
ours.</i></p>

<p>It was packed solid with what looked like bedsprings, coiled and
conical, eight feet long and blazing with a crackling bluish light that
hurt the eyes. They slid down the beam and popped out into the lab with
a swift precision that meant they knew exactly what they were doing, to
cluster like sizzling blue glow-worms about the smoking generator.</p>

<p>Half-dazed as I was, the truth hit me with a shock that curled my hair
like an Angora rug. Those sputtering fire-worms were not ganging around
the dead generator just to get warm.</p>

<p>They were <i>studying</i> it.</p>

<p>I got up somehow and headed for the laboratory exit, carrying Dora's
limp form in my arms. The military beat me to it. The generals and
their staffs were already there, jamming the doorway like a herd of
stampeded sheep. I was the last man out, leaving the fire-worms still
circling about the smoking generator.</p>

<p>Doc Maxey had stopped on the graveled gyro court halfway between the
lab and his house on the hill above but he wasn't waiting for us. He
was staring back toward the lab with his scrubby beard fluttering in
the night wind and his eyes shining like wet marbles.</p>

<p>I looked back to see smoke pouring out of the laboratory windows. Great
sparks of light shot out through it but it wasn't until I understood
Doc's yammering that I knew what they were.</p>

<p>"They've left the rift!" he was yelling. "They're free—we've let those
monsters loose on the world!"</p>

<p>The fire-worms scattered systematically, taking off in every direction
like snaky skyrockets. One minute the air was full of them—the next
they were gone.</p>

<p>"This new Di-tube came through when our strain-bubble burst," I said,
looking up at the shaft of vacancy dwindling away into the sky. Dora
came out of her faint then but I didn't put her down—I liked holding
her too well. "But how, Doc, and from where?"</p>

<p>"From superspace, the plane of existence immediately above ours," Doc
said, wringing his hands. "The energy backlash from our generator must
have weakened the spatial barrier between dimensions, enabling them to
break through at the point of stress."</p>

<p>Even I could understand that. Dora got it too and hid her face against
my chest. "We've got to stop them somehow," she said. "Jerry don't just
stand here—<i>do</i> something!"</p>

<p>At another time it would have been funny—she was asking <i>me</i> to stop
this catastrophe when the best brains in the Western Hemisphere were
legging it up the hill with nothing on their minds but mileage.</p>

<p>"This is no time for jokes," I told her. "Let's get up to the house and
call Washington, Doc."</p>

<p>There were two phones in the house but we couldn't get within
yelling distance of either of them. Both generals were on the wire,
countermanding each other's orders right and left and screaming for the
Air Marines. The living-room t-v was blaring full blast at a circle of
both Eastern and Western hemispheres and they were hitting us right
where we lived.</p>

<p>In the space of a few minutes those speeding fire-worms had spread
over the entire globe. They had penetrated the defense screens of both
Eastern and Western hemispheres and they were hitting us right where we
lived.</p>

<p>"The invaders do not seem to be conscious of us as entities," the
newscaster gabbled. "But they are attracted to concentrations of
nuclear materials as flies are drawn to honey and for the same reason.
Every atomic pile on Earth has been besieged by these alien monsters,
who are draining away our nuclear energy like leeches. At the present
rate all smaller piles will soon be inerted and larger ones—wait, a
special bulletin....</p>

<p>"Latest information sheds some light upon the sudden onslaught of the
Blazers, as the invaders are being called by a public still largely
unaware of its danger. They first appeared some twenty minutes ago
during a top-secret military experiment at the Connecticut laboratory
of Dr. Marvin Maxey, well-known scientific—"</p>

<p>Somebody shut off the set and we stared at each other in blank silence.
Nobody even tried to pass the buck—fixing the blame wasn't important
now. All that mattered was that unless the Blazers were stopped
immediately our world was finished. Those fission-hungry fiends would
strip us to the last erg of our nuclear energy—and to a world geared
to atomic power that meant the end.</p>

<p>We had forgotten the coming war completely. There was no point in
worrying now about being blasted out of our beds. In a few days most of
us would be starving to death in them.</p>

<p>The brasshats camped on the telephones until daylight before they gave
it up. Dora was dishing up scrambled eggs and coffee to Doc and me in
the kitchen when Three-star Corbin stumbled in, out on his feet.</p>

<p>"You were right, Dr. Maxey," he groaned. "Using your Dimension-tube as
a weapon was a mistake, a cosmic and irremediable error. These invaders
are indestructible—the concerted might of Allied Military has failed
to repel them. The doom of Earth is sealed."</p>

<p>Doc plucked unhappily at his beard.</p>

<p>"Surely we can retool our industries to electric power in time," he
said. But he didn't sound sure. He sounded beaten.</p>

<p>Corbin shook his head grayly. "You don't understand the psychology of
panic, Doctor. Law is dependent upon power. When power fails the mob
rules. By this time tomorrow government will have begun to break down.
Civilization as we know it will disintegrate within a matter of days."</p>

<p>I had known that all along, of course, but all of a sudden the real
enormity of what was happening hit me like a boot in the stomach.
There sat Doc Maxey, one of the most brilliant physicists in the
world—stumped. Beside him drooped Three-star General Corbin, high
commander of Allied Military, and he was as helpless as a corner
newsboy. A top-flight crew of research technicians stood around in the
living room like so many cigar-store dummies, looking at each other
blankly while the world skidded to ruin on a slippery cosmic banana
peel.</p>

<p>Dora came over and put an arm across my shoulders. As suddenly as I had
got scared I got mad.</p>

<p>It wasn't just the idea of the world going bust that burned me. This
was a personal business that threatened Dora and me and our friends
and all the millions and millions of people we had never even seen.
Here was the lot of us headed A-over-T straight back to the stone ages.
A few days more and people we had known and loved would be hunting
each other through the streets with clubs, driven to murder and worse
because a crew of greedy alien fire-worms had a taste for atomic
fission.</p>

<p>It was a hopeless affair and I knew it. But down inside me a nagging
little ghost of an idea kept whispering that we must have overlooked
<i>something</i>, that somewhere there must be a loophole these high-voltage
intellects had missed. Sometimes, I told myself, theorists can be as
dumb as ordinary people. Sometimes they just can't see the trees for
the woods.</p>

<p>"Look," I said. "We're missing a bet somewhere. We built the Di-tube in
the beginning to...."</p>

<p>Doc gave me a pitying look. "Will you keep your infantile inspirations
to yourself, Gerald? I'm trying to think."</p>

<p>I turned to Three-star Corbin, getting eager because the idea had just
nudged me again. It wasn't clear yet—but it was there, begging to be
recognized like a half-remembered name that trembles on the tip of your
tongue.</p>

<p>"Will you listen, General? There's a chance that...."</p>

<p>The general gave me a poisonous glare. "Can't you see that I'm planning
a course of action? Shut up or I'll have you thrown out!"</p>

<p>I jumped up, knocking over my coffee, and walked out. Dora came outside
after me and caught my arm. "Jerry! What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going down to the lab," I said. "Maybe I'm nuts but I think we've
still got a chance to beat this infernal thing."</p>

<p>The sun came up round and rosy while we walked down to the lab and I
felt my scalp prickle when I saw the no-colored shaft of the Blazers'
Di-tube rising against it like a black finger of doom.</p>

<p>"There used to be an early mail rocket out of Waterbury at sunrise,"
Dora said softly, "and a passenger flight just afterward. Remember how
we used to complain because they woke us up, Jerry? And now—"</p>

<p>"Now there won't be any more rockets," I said. "There won't be any
more movie dates or drive-ins or corny floor shows, no more football
games or Sunday afternoon spins in the country. There won't be any more
people after awhile, except a scattering of gee-strung savages running
wild in packs and maybe eating each other. Go back and look after Doc,
will you? He needs you."</p>

<p>But she wouldn't go.</p>

<p>The original Di-tube model was still in its corner, undamaged. I had
done a solid job of wiring and testing that rig and it had stood the
blast without even so much as a bent helix.</p>

<p>I checked it over, working fast, and bolted on a power feed rectifier
that would adapt it to a mobile a.c. input. The little cabinet was too
heavy to lift, so I edged it onto a hand-truck and trundled it out of
the lab and across the graveled landing court to the shed where Doc's
gyro stood.</p>

<p>Dora helped me hoist it inside and bolt it down. Ten minutes later,
when it was all set to go, I tried again to talk her into going back.
There wasn't more than a chance in ten thousand that my idea would work
and if it did I'd be left stranded in an alien dimension. And besides
that....</p>

<p>I should have saved my breath. "I don't know what you're planning,"
Dora said, squeezing into the seat beside me. "But it doesn't matter.
I'm going with you, Jerry."</p>

<p>I looked out at the Blazers' Di-tube, standing black against the
sunrise, and I didn't argue. Maybe she was right. Why not go now,
together, and get it over with?</p>

<p>"All right," I said, and sent the gyro whirring out of the shed. "Hang
on tight, Kid—here goes nothing!"</p>

<p>The MP's poured out of the house just as we took the air. I could see
them yelling and waving their neuroblast guns but there was no point in
waiting. They wouldn't have listened anyway.</p>

<p>The lab slid under us and we shot straight for the big Di-tube
looming up ahead. Breaking into it made me feel the way the Twisters
looked—inside out, upside down, impossibly extended and at the same
time compressed to microscopic smallness in a vast hueless infinity
that lasted for I don't know how long.</p>

<p>It turned out that there really was no such thing as time—or distance
either for that matter—between dimensions. The Di-tube itself was a
sort of sensory compromise, an illusion created by the mind's effort to
visualize a cross-section of a continuum that can't be visualized.</p>

<p>Our transit made me think of the two-dimensional ant. One instant we
were over the lab—the next we were out of this world, in superspace.</p>

<p>The Blazers' dimension was worse than the Di-tube.</p>

<p>Looking through the gyro's window made me feel like a schizophrenic
drunkard with a set of mirror-image screamies, watching impossibly
elastic nightmare shadows flickering across a crazy-house
looking-glass. There was an upside-down horizon that heaved like a bowl
of phosphorescent jelly, a scattering of what might have been animated
buildings and, close at hand, a great flurry of helical Blazers,
circling like mad about something I <i>did</i> recognize.</p>

<p>It was a huge orange strain-bubble, a space-warp set up by whatever
sort of generator that Blazers had made to pierce our dimension.</p>

<p>There wasn't a chance of making any real sense of what I saw. It would
have been easier for a flea on a camel's back to describe what went on
in a three-ring circus.</p>

<p>But the strain-bubble was what I had come to see. The rest didn't
matter too much.</p>

<p>"Warm up the model," I said. My voice had a thin, windy sound and I
couldn't keep it steady. "From the way they're flitting around that
bubble they've got troubles of their own—and they're going to have
more!"</p>

<p>Dora understood then what I had in mind. "Their generator is weakening
the barrier to the dimension above this one!" she said. "Jerry,
something is trying to break through, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Our little Di-tube model gave a tentative sizzle, and it sounded
pitifully weak. Using it was like tackling a grizzly with a hatpin—but
there was no help for that now.</p>

<p>"They aren't zipping around that space-blister for exercise," I said.
"Maybe they don't know exactly what is on the other side, but they're
worried."</p>

<p>That was the whole crazy million-to-one chance that had brought me
there. It stood to reason that the Blazers' Di-tube generator would
create a strain-warp similar to ours in their own dimension. If we
could puncture their weak spot as they had punctured ours....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The two-inch beam of our little Di-tube shot out, boring wide of the
outlandish blob that was the Blazers' generator. I swung it back,
correcting my aim, and the heat went on.</p>

<p>The Blazers dropped their work instantly and whirled up toward us. But
for once they were slow—our little Di-shaft sliced through and beyond
them. And touched the strain-bubble.</p>

<p>There was a searing flash and a soundless jarring concussion, and the
thing went up in a blinding shower of orange sparks.</p>

<p>It was over as quickly as that. The Blazers swarming toward us
whipped back to man the breach we had made and they had unexpected
reenforcements—they must have alerted their party on Earth already
because the wavering Di-tube was suddenly crowded with returning
fire-worms, zipping back home to superspace.</p>

<p>I swung our gyro toward the fading Di-shaft, gave it full throttle and
prayed. Dora was gripping my arm and crying something in my ear but I
didn't understand a word of it.</p>

<p>I looked back once, just before we hit the crumbling column. The shower
of sparks had died out, and in its place stood a familiar shaft of
vacancy, boring outward into the upside-down sky. Something squeezed
through the break while I watched, beating back the Blazers who fought
to stop it.</p>

<p>I got only a glimpse but I'll never be the same again.</p>

<p>It was a Twister but it didn't look like the ones we had seen through
our Di-tube. What we had seen then were only reversed projections, Doc
Maxey said later, transposed cross-sections altered to something we
could partially visualize with our limited senses.</p>

<p>But this Twister wasn't transposed and it didn't look like an
inside-out octopus. It writhed and swelled and radiated a dark
devouring <i>coldness</i> that snuffed out Blazers like sparks against an
ice cake.</p>

<p>Other Twisters may have followed it—I wouldn't know. We hit the
Di-tube then and at the same moment the Blazers' generator blew up with
an appalling blast....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next instant we were sailing over a parched and blazing desert, a
glaring waste of jagged lava that stretched away on every side through
a shimmering haze of heat. Black basalt cliffs jutted up here and
there, warped and eroded by scorching winds.</p>

<p>Dora and I looked at each other dumbly.</p>

<p>"We got away," Dora said. "But what sort of dimension is <i>this</i>? Where
are we, Jerry?"</p>

<p>It was a good question. Judging from the landscape the collapsing
Di-tube could have shunted us straight into the ash-bin of hell. There
wasn't a twinkle of water anywhere, not a wisp of cloud nor a flutter
of bird in the sky. Just a vast wind-swept desolation, parching to a
sandy crisp under a flaming sun.</p>

<p>I was fumbling for an answer when Dora caught my arm. "Look,
Jerry—there, over the horizon. Isn't that smoke?"</p>

<p>I looked and it was—a thin white streamer of smoke rising across the
badlands, wavering at the top like the crooking of an enigmatic finger.</p>

<p>"We may as well investigate," I said, heeling the gyro toward it. "If
it means another danger we might as well face it now as later."</p>

<p>But it wasn't another alien menace.</p>

<p>It was a sheep camp at the edge of the lava beds not far from San
Rafael, New Mexico. The Mexican herder ran like a jackrabbit when we
swooped down, never having seen a gyro before, but at Acomita—over on
the Pueblo Indian reservation—we found a government agent who gave us
our bearings and brought us up to date.</p>

<p>After what we had been through, it was only a minor shock to learn that
it wasn't 1982 any longer. It was 1985 and the Blazers had been gone
for so long that they were practically forgotten. Doc Maxey explained
later, when we showed up with a small army of telepaper reporters at
his Connecticut home, that our being caught in the collapsing Di-field
had somehow distorted the time values involved and had shunted us three
years into the future.</p>

<p>We took his word for it.</p>

<p>"The proponents of the circular-universe theory were more right than
they knew," Doc said, beaming and waggling his beard. "There would seem
to be only three major planes of existence, each existing in a state of
reciprocal contiguity to the other two.</p>

<p>"I suspect also that spherical space is actually a unilateral continuum
of three layers, restricting lateral transit to one direction in
much the same fashion as a rectifying crystal governs the flow of
electrons. That would explain why the Twisters could force entrance
to the Blazers' dimension, once you destroyed the strain-bubble in
superspace, but could not enter our plane from their own subspatial
continuum."</p>

<p>"It's all physics to me," I said, holding Dora's hand and feeling
almost safe again. "Only one thing worries me—did the Blazers lose the
rhubarb we ran out on or will we have them back in our hair again some
day?"</p>

<p>Doc gave me a startled squint and fuzzed his beard goatishly. "Get
that model generator out of the gyro," he ordered, sounding like his
old self. "We'll never know what the situation really is unless we
reactivate the Di-tube and—"</p>

<p>"And start that ratrace again?" I yelled. I could see the whole crazy
business happening over and over in a sort of vicious cosmic circle,
and the thought made my scalp crawl. "Over my dead body you will!"</p>

<p>Dora and I had planned to find a minister next but the big moment had
to wait. I had one final adjustment to make on that infernal Di-tube
model first.</p>

<p>I made it on the spot—with a large sledgehammer.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Einstein has received a multitude of well-deserved honors but
as far as we know science fiction has yet to do him direct homage.
And surely he rates it—for had he not, some sixty years ago, come up
with his full-born theory of the fourth dimension (and won worldwide
publicity for said dimension) STF would have been deprived of one
of its basic staples. Without the fourth (and fifth, sixth, seventh
and so on) dimension, authors of speculative fantasy would have
been left stumbling amid the distorted metaphysics of their Gothic
forerunners—and would thereby have been constantly at war with the
clergy. Thanks to Dr. Einstein they can roam the dimensions at will,
threatened by no purgatory except that of creative writing itself or
of the possibility of a rejection slip.</i></p>
